How the Blue Screen leads to "Corrupted Files"
​A Blue Screen is like a car slamming on the brakes at 100 mph.
​The Data Write: At any given second, Windows is writing thousands of tiny "notes" to your hard drive (logs, system updates, registry settings).
​The Sudden Stop: When the Blue Screen happens, the power to the hard drive is cut instantly. If Windows was 50% finished writing a critical file (like a part of ntoskrnl.exe), that file is now "Corrupted." 
The Result: The file is now a "broken recipe." Next time you boot up, Windows tries to read it, can't understand it, and crashes again.
​3. General Causes of a Blue Screen (The "Big Four")
​In general, 99% of Blue Screens are caused by one of these: Hardware Conflict (Your Case): Two parts of the computer (TPM and CPU) disagreeing on who owns which piece of memory.
​Bad Drivers: Software that tells hardware to do something impossible (like a Graphics driver asking for more power than the battery can give).
​Overheating/Physical Failure: RAM or a Hard Drive physically dying or getting too hot.
​Power Fluctuations: Like when you unplugged your IdeaPad and the voltage dropped too fast for the glitched TPM to handle.

The Conflict: If the TPM sees Windows trying to connect with the "wrong" ID (the mismatch) too many times, it enters a security lockout.
​The Result: Once the chip is in lockout, it ignores all commands—even from Lenovo Vantage. A standard reboot doesn't reset the chip's internal timer. Only a Power Drain (the 60-second hold) or a Clear TPM command 
in the BIOS can "wake it up" from this defensive stance. Sometimes Lenovo Vantage downloads the installer for the firmware, but the actual installation happens in a pre-Windows environment (a black screen before the Lenovo logo).
​The Conflict: If your Windows files were corrupted (the ntoskrnl.exe issue), Windows might have failed to send the "trigger" command to the motherboard to start the update.
​The Result: Vantage thinks it did its job because it downloaded the file, but the Motherboard is still running the old version. They are essentially "speaking two different languages.”
​In Systems Engineering, your laptop isn't just one machine; it is a "system of systems." The process of your computer turning on is called a Chain of Trust.
​The Root of Trust: This is your TPM chip.
​The Handshake: Every piece of software must "prove" its identity to the layer below it before it is allowed to run.
​The Failure: When you updated the BIOS but the TPM didn't "agree," you broke the Chain of Trust. In Systems Engineering, this is known as an Interface Mismatch. The two components are still healthy, 
but the "bridge" between them has the wrong coordinates. ​The reason the power button light stayed on (the "Zombie" state) is a failure in System State Management.
​The Goal: A system should have a clear "On" state and "Off" state.
​The Reality: Because of Modern Standby, your laptop entered an "Undefined State." The software told the hardware to power down, but the hardware was waiting for a security confirmation from the TPM that never came. 
Because the system was "stuck" between two states, it consumed battery and stayed hot, which is a common System Integration failure. Systems Engineers use a "V-Model" to design and fix things. You actually followed it perfectly:
​Decomposition (Going Down): You broke the problem into layers (TPM -> BIOS -> Windows).
​Integration (Going Up): You repaired the files (sfc /scannow), then the handshake (BIOS reset), and finally checked the UI (Start button)
