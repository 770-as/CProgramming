/*To understand the mmu in windows you must understand the hardware it controls. Since windows 
runs on intel amd architecture look for intel 64 and IA 32 architecture software developer.
Understand the bit level structure of page table entries that the windows kernel modifies to 
manage memory permissions. Understand MDL (memory descriptor lists) system space vs user space.
The PFN database is the central data structure the windows kernel uses to track the state of 
every physical page of RAM. Virtual to physical address translation details the software hardware 
interface how the windows kernel configures the MMU to perform address translation using page 
tables. A significant portion of the book is dedicated toworking set management the collection of 
pages currently residing in physical ram for a process, it explains the algorithms to trim memory
when the system is under pressure. How file data is mapped into a process's virtual address space
using Section Objects (the underlying mechanism for mmap in windows) and how the kernel handles the 
resulting page faults. 
The page fault handler: the book explains the complex logic executed by the kernel when the hardware
MMU raises a page fault exception, including how it determines whether to read data from the disk
retrieve it from the standby list or zero out a new page. 
System memory pools: it provides technical details on the management of paged and non paged pools
which are the primary memory allocation areas for kernel mode drivers and components. 
It is possible to model the PFN database as a very large array of structs where each struct contains
an active, modified, standby, free, bad and zeroed. */
