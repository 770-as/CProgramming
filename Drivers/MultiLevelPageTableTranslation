/*Virtual address space : 36 bit=64GB
Physical address space : 32-bit 4 GB of actual RAM
Page Size 4 KB
Page Table Entry 4 bytes 
You are debugging a page fault on a process. The cpu tries to access the virtual address: 0x123456789
How many bits of the virtual address will you use for the directory index, for the page table index
and for the offset ? 
The tlb is a high speed virtual cache that stores mappings recently used. When the cpu generates the 
virtual address, the MMU doesnt immediately go to ram, it extracts the virtual page number. 
The MMU must now perform a page walk, reading the page directory from ram then reading the page table
from ram (2 bus transactions), once it finds the physical address, it updates the TLB such that the 
next access to this page will be hit, if it is on the disk it triggers a segmentation page. The TLB
is SRAM based and physically integrated into the MMU.  
TLB thrashing occurs when the scan is made on a huge amount of data. The first 64 entries are added 
to the TLB, since we just move forward and not backward, each time a new entry is met, the RAM will 
kill the first TLB mapping and rebuild a new one which takes many cpu cycles. On a 1GB of data, this
wastes 26 million cpu cycles because there are roughyl 260 000 entries and each cost 100 cpu cyles.
