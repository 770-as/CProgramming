/*Write a C program that prompts the user for a filename. Open the file in write mode and write a few lines of text 
into it. Close the file. Reopen the same file in read mode. Read each line from the file, convert all characters to 
uppercase, and print the modified line to the console. Close the file. Use stdlib.h for memory allocation if needed,
and string.h for string manipulation functions like strlen() and strupr() (or implement your own version as it's not
standard C).*/
